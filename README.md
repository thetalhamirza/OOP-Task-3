# OOP Lab 3

This repository contains solutions to various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab exercises implemented in C++. Below is a brief overview of each C++ file included in this repository:

## Files Overview

1. **Q1.cpp**: This program demonstrates the use of classes and objects in C++. It includes the definition of a class and showcases how to create objects and access their members.
    
2. **Q2-DateTest.cpp**: This file contains a program that tests the functionality of a `Date` class. It includes operations such as setting and displaying dates, and may include date validation.
    
3. **Q3.cpp**: This program focuses on constructors and destructors in C++. It illustrates how constructors are used for object initialization and how destructors handle cleanup.
    
4. **Q4-EmployeeTest.cpp**: This file contains a program that tests an `Employee` class. It likely includes features such as setting employee details, calculating salaries, and displaying employee information.
    
5. **Q5-BookTest.cpp**: This program tests a `Book` class, possibly including attributes like title, author, and ISBN, along with methods to display book details.
    
6. **Q6.cpp**: This file includes a program that demonstrates advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, or operator overloading.
    

## Header Files

- **Book.h**: Header file containing the declaration of the `Book` class, including its attributes and member functions.
    
- **Date.h**: Header file for the `Date` class, defining the structure and functions related to date manipulation.
    
- **Employee.h**: Header file declaring the `Employee` class, outlining its properties and methods.
    

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the C++ programs, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed**: You can use `g++`, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection.
    
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt**.
    
3. **Navigate to the directory containing the desired `.cpp` file**.
    
4. **Compile the program**: Use the following command to compile:
    
    `g++ -o output_name filename.cpp`
    
    Replace `output_name` with your desired name for the executable and `filename.cpp` with the name of the C++ file.
    
5. **Run the executable**:
    
    `./output_name`
    
    On Windows, you can run the executable directly by typing `output_name` and pressing Enter.
    

## Notes

- Ensure that the header files (`.h` files) are in the same directory as the `.cpp` files or adjust the include paths accordingly.
    
- If you encounter any issues during compilation or execution, verify that your compiler is properly installed and that there are no syntax errors in the code.
